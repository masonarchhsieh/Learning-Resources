
Object Tracking:

	Color Filtering:
		cvtColor() -> from BGR to HSV
		inRange() -> between a max and min
	Contour finding:
		findContours()
		moments method


	Step1: 
		Convert image from BGR to HSV
		(Blue, Green, Red) -> (Hue, Saturation, Value)

	Step2:
		Filter the colors of interest between a MIN and MAX threshold

	Step3:
		Morphological Operations
			Dilate and Erode:
			ERODE:	"erodes" into white space. Making it smaller or non existent
			DILATE: "dilates" white space. Making it larger
	Final:
		FindContours:
			input: binary image
			output: a vector of contours. The outline of all objects found in binary image
		"Moments" method
			input: vector of contours
			output: x, y coordinates of largest contour
			defined by its inner area
