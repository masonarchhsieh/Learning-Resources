What is Mat?
	Mat is basically a class with two data parts: the matrix header (containing information such as the size of the matrix, the method used for storing, at which address is the matrix stored, and so on) and a pointer to the matrix containing the pixel values (taking any dimensionality depending on the method chosen for storing) . The matrix header size is constant, however the size of the matrix itself may vary from image to image and usually is larger by orders of magnitude.

	OpenCV is an image processing library. It contains a large collection of image processing functions. To solve a computational challenge, most of the time you will end up using multiple functions of the library. Because of this, passing images to functions is a common practice.


There are, however, many other color systems each with their own advantages:

	RGB is the most common as our eyes use something similar, however keep in mind that OpenCV standard display system composes colors using the BGR color space (a switch of the red and blue channel).
	The HSV and HLS decompose colors into their hue, saturation and value/luminance components, which is a more natural way for us to describe colors. You might, for example, dismiss the last component, making your algorithm less sensible to the light conditions of the input image.
	YCrCb is used by the popular JPEG image format.
	CIE L*a*b* is a perceptually uniform color space, which comes handy if you need to measure the distance of a given color to another color.


Then we need to specify the data type to use for storing the elements and the number of channels per matrix point. To do this we have multiple definitions constructed according to the following convention:

    1 CV_[The number of bits per item][Signed or Unsigned][Type Prefix]C[The channel number]
