       %k     hour, space padded ( 0..23); same as %_H

       %l     hour, space padded ( 1..12); same as %_I

       %m     month (01..12)

       %M     minute (00..59)

       %n     a newline

       %N     nanoseconds (000000000..999999999)

       %S     second (00..60)

       %t     a tab

       %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S

       %u     day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday

       %U     week number of year, with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)

       %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday

       %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The following optional flags may follow '%':

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After  any  flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal number; then an optional modifier, which is either E to use the
       locale's alternate representations if available, or O to use the locale's alternate numeric symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use tzselect(1) to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show the local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles" 09:00 next Fri'

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29
       16:21:42"  or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating calendar date, time of day, time zone, day of
       week, relative time, relative date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the day.  The date string format
       is more complex than is easily documented here but is fully described in the info documentation.

NAME
       cal - display a calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
       cal [options] <timestamp|monthname>

DESCRIPTION
       cal displays a simple calendar.  If no arguments are specified, the current month is displayed.

       The  month  may  be  specified  as  a number (1-12), as a month name or as an abbreviated month name according to the current
       locales.

OPTIONS
       -1, --one
              Display single month output.  (This is the default.)

       -3, --three
              Display three months spanning the date.

       -n , --months number
              Display number of months, starting from the month containing the date.

       -S, --span
              Display months spanning the date.

       -s, --sunday
              Display Sunday as the first day of the week.

       -m, --monday
              Display Monday as the first day of the week.

       -j, --julian
              Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

       -y, --year
              Display a calendar for the whole year.

       -Y, --twelve
              Display a calendar for the next twelve months.

       -w, --week[=number]
              Display week numbers in the calendar (US or ISO-8601).

       --color[=when]
              Colorize the output.  The optional argument when can be auto, never or always.  If the when argument  is  omitted,  it
              defaults  to  auto.  The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see the --help output.  See also the
              COLORS section.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

PARAMETERS
       Single digits-only parameter (e.g. 'cal 2020')
              Specifies the year to be displayed; note the year must be fully specified: cal 89 will  not  display  a  calendar  for
              1989.

       Single string parameter (e.g. 'cal tomorrow' or 'cal August')
              Specifies timestamp or a month name (or abbreviated name) according to the current locales.

              The special placeholders are accepted when parsing timestamp, "now" may be used to refer to the current time, "today",
              "yesterday", "tomorrow" refer to of the current day, the day before or the next day, respectively.

              The relative date specifications are also accepted, in this case "+" is evaluated to the current time plus the  speci‐
              fied  time  span.  Correspondingly,  a  time span that is prefixed with "-" is evaluated to the current time minus the
              specified time span, for example '+2days'. Instead of prefixing the time span with "+" or "-", it may also be suffixed
              with a space and the word "left" or "ago" (for example '1 week ago').

       Two parameters (e.g. 'cal 11 2020')
              Denote the month (1 - 12) and year.

       Three parameters (e.g. 'cal 25 11 2020')
              Denote the day (1-31), month and year, and the day will be highlighted if the calendar is displayed on a terminal.  If
              no parameters are specified, the current month's calendar is displayed.

NOTES
       A year starts on January 1.  The first day of the week is determined by the locale.

       The week numbering depends on the choice of the first day of the week.  If Sunday (the default) is used for the first day  of
       the  week, then the customary North American numbering will be used, i.e. the first Sunday of the year starts the first week.
       If Monday is selected, then the ISO-8601 standard week numbering is used, where the first Thursday of the  year  is  in  week
       number 1.

COLORS
       Implicit coloring can be disabled as follows:

              touch /etc/terminal-colors.d/cal.disable

       See terminal-colors.d(5) for more details about colorization configuration.

BUGS
       The  cal program uses the 3rd of September 1752 as the date of the Gregorian calendar reformation -- that is when it happened
       in Great Britain and its colonies (including what is now the USA).  Starting at that date, eleven  days  were  eliminated  by
       this reformation, so the calendar for that month is rather unusual.  The actual historical dates at which the calendar reform
       happened in all the different countries (locales) are ignored.

       Alternative calendars, such as the Umm al-Qura, the Solar Hijri, the Ge'ez, or the lunisolar Hindu, are not supported.

HISTORY
       A cal command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.

AVAILABILITY
       The cal command is part of the util-linux package and is available from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h is supplied.

       A  FILE  argument  string of - is handled specially and causes touch to change the times of the file associated with standard
       output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the timestamps  of  a
              symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29
       16:21:42" or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating calendar date, time of day, time zone, day  of
       week, relative time, relative date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the day.  The date string format
       is more complex than is easily documented here but is fully described in the info documentation.

       %k     hour, space padded ( 0..23); same as %_H

       %l     hour, space padded ( 1..12); same as %_I

       %m     month (01..12)

       %M     minute (00..59)

       %n     a newline

       %N     nanoseconds (000000000..999999999)

       %S     second (00..60)

       %t     a tab

       %T     time; same as %H:%M:%S

       %u     day of week (1..7); 1 is Monday

       %U     week number of year, with Sunday as first day of week (00..53)

       %V     ISO week number, with Monday as first day of week (01..53)

       %w     day of week (0..6); 0 is Sunday

       %W     week number of year, with Monday as first day of week (00..53)

       %:z    +hh:mm numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00)

       %::z   +hh:mm:ss numeric time zone (e.g., -04:00:00)

       %:::z  numeric time zone with : to necessary precision (e.g., -04, +05:30)

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The following optional flags may follow '%':

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After  any  flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal number; then an optional modifier, which is either E to use the
       locale's alternate representations if available, or O to use the locale's alternate numeric symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use tzselect(1) to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show the local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles" 09:00 next Fri'

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29
       16:21:42"  or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating calendar date, time of day, time zone, day of
       week, relative time, relative date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the day.  The date string format
       is more complex than is easily documented here but is fully described in the info documentation.

NAME
       cal - display a calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
       cal [options] <timestamp|monthname>

DESCRIPTION
       cal displays a simple calendar.  If no arguments are specified, the current month is displayed.

       The  month  may  be  specified  as  a number (1-12), as a month name or as an abbreviated month name according to the current
       locales.

OPTIONS
       -1, --one
              Display single month output.  (This is the default.)

       -3, --three
              Display three months spanning the date.

       -n , --months number
              Display number of months, starting from the month containing the date.

       -S, --span
              Display months spanning the date.

       -s, --sunday
              Display Sunday as the first day of the week.

       -m, --monday
              Display Monday as the first day of the week.

       -j, --julian
              Display Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from January 1).

       -y, --year
              Display a calendar for the whole year.

       -Y, --twelve
              Display a calendar for the next twelve months.

       -w, --week[=number]
              Display week numbers in the calendar (US or ISO-8601).

       --color[=when]
              Colorize the output.  The optional argument when can be auto, never or always.  If the when argument  is  omitted,  it
              defaults  to  auto.  The colors can be disabled; for the current built-in default see the --help output.  See also the
              COLORS section.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

PARAMETERS
       Single digits-only parameter (e.g. 'cal 2020')
              Specifies the year to be displayed; note the year must be fully specified: cal 89 will  not  display  a  calendar  for
              1989.

       Single string parameter (e.g. 'cal tomorrow' or 'cal August')
              Specifies timestamp or a month name (or abbreviated name) according to the current locales.

              The special placeholders are accepted when parsing timestamp, "now" may be used to refer to the current time, "today",
              "yesterday", "tomorrow" refer to of the current day, the day before or the next day, respectively.

              The relative date specifications are also accepted, in this case "+" is evaluated to the current time plus the  speci‐
              fied  time  span.  Correspondingly,  a  time span that is prefixed with "-" is evaluated to the current time minus the
              specified time span, for example '+2days'. Instead of prefixing the time span with "+" or "-", it may also be suffixed
              with a space and the word "left" or "ago" (for example '1 week ago').

       Two parameters (e.g. 'cal 11 2020')
              Denote the month (1 - 12) and year.

       Three parameters (e.g. 'cal 25 11 2020')
              Denote the day (1-31), month and year, and the day will be highlighted if the calendar is displayed on a terminal.  If
              no parameters are specified, the current month's calendar is displayed.

NOTES
       A year starts on January 1.  The first day of the week is determined by the locale.

       The week numbering depends on the choice of the first day of the week.  If Sunday (the default) is used for the first day  of
       the  week, then the customary North American numbering will be used, i.e. the first Sunday of the year starts the first week.
       If Monday is selected, then the ISO-8601 standard week numbering is used, where the first Thursday of the  year  is  in  week
       number 1.

COLORS
       Implicit coloring can be disabled as follows:

              touch /etc/terminal-colors.d/cal.disable

       See terminal-colors.d(5) for more details about colorization configuration.

BUGS
       The  cal program uses the 3rd of September 1752 as the date of the Gregorian calendar reformation -- that is when it happened
       in Great Britain and its colonies (including what is now the USA).  Starting at that date, eleven  days  were  eliminated  by
       this reformation, so the calendar for that month is rather unusual.  The actual historical dates at which the calendar reform
       happened in all the different countries (locales) are ignored.

       Alternative calendars, such as the Umm al-Qura, the Solar Hijri, the Ge'ez, or the lunisolar Hindu, are not supported.

HISTORY
       A cal command appeared in Version 6 AT&T UNIX.

AVAILABILITY
       The cal command is part of the util-linux package and is available from ftp://ftp.kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/util-linux/.

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

       A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h is supplied.

       A  FILE  argument  string of - is handled specially and causes touch to change the times of the file associated with standard
       output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced file (useful only on systems that can change the timestamps  of  a
              symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.

DATE STRING
       The --date=STRING is a mostly free format human readable date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004 16:21:42 -0800" or "2004-02-29
       16:21:42" or even "next Thursday".  A date string may contain items indicating calendar date, time of day, time zone, day  of
       week, relative time, relative date, and numbers.  An empty string indicates the beginning of the day.  The date string format
       is more complex than is easily documented here but is fully described in the info documentation.

       %Z     alphabetic time zone abbreviation (e.g., EDT)

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The fol‐
       lowing optional flags may follow '%':

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After any flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal
       number; then an optional modifier, which is either E to use
       the  locale's  alternate representations if available, or O
       to use the locale's alternate numeric symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use  tzselect(1)
       to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show  the  local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast
       of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles"  09:00  next
              Fri'

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a mostly free format human readable
       date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004  16:21:42  -0800"  or
       "2004-02-29  16:21:42"  or  even  "next  Thursday".  A date
       string may contain items indicating calendar date, time  of
       day,  time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,
       and numbers.  An empty string indicates  the  beginning  of
       the  day.   The  date string format is more complex than is
       easily documented here but is fully described in  the  info
       documentation.

CAL(1)                     User Commands                    CAL(1)

NAME
       cal - display a calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
       cal [options] <timestamp|monthname>

DESCRIPTION
       cal displays a simple calendar.  If no arguments are speci‐
       fied, the current month is displayed.

       The month may be specified as a number (1-12), as  a  month
       name  or as an abbreviated month name according to the cur‐
       rent locales.

OPTIONS
       -1, --one
              Display single month output.  (This is the default.)

       -3, --three
              Display three months spanning the date.

       -n , --months number
              Display number of months, starting  from  the  month
              containing the date.

       -S, --span
              Display months spanning the date.

       -s, --sunday
              Display Sunday as the first day of the week.

       -m, --monday
              Display Monday as the first day of the week.

       -j, --julian
              Display  Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from
              January 1).

       -y, --year
              Display a calendar for the whole year.

       -Y, --twelve
              Display a calendar for the next twelve months.

       -w, --week[=number]
              Display  week  numbers  in  the  calendar   (US   or
              ISO-8601).

       --color[=when]
              Colorize the output.  The optional argument when can
              be auto, never or always.  If the when  argument  is
              omitted,  it  defaults  to  auto.  The colors can be
              disabled; for the current built-in default  see  the
              --help output.  See also the COLORS section.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

PARAMETERS
       Single digits-only parameter (e.g. 'cal 2020')
              Specifies  the  year  to be displayed; note the year
              must be fully specified: cal 89 will not  display  a
              calendar for 1989.

       Single  string  parameter  (e.g.  'cal  tomorrow'  or  'cal
       August')
              Specifies timestamp or a month name (or  abbreviated
              name) according to the current locales.

              The  special  placeholders are accepted when parsing
              timestamp, "now" may be used to refer to the current
              time,  "today",  "yesterday", "tomorrow" refer to of
              the current day, the day before  or  the  next  day,
              respectively.

              The  relative date specifications are also accepted,
              in this case "+" is evaluated to  the  current  time
              plus  the  specified  time  span. Correspondingly, a
              time span that is prefixed with "-" is evaluated  to
              the  current time minus the specified time span, for
              example '+2days'. Instead of prefixing the time span
              with  "+"  or  "-",  it  may also be suffixed with a
              space and the word "left" or "ago" (for  example  '1
              week ago').

       Two parameters (e.g. 'cal 11 2020')
              Denote the month (1 - 12) and year.

       Three parameters (e.g. 'cal 25 11 2020')
              Denote  the  day (1-31), month and year, and the day
              will be highlighted if the calendar is displayed  on
              a  terminal.   If  no  parameters are specified, the
              current month's calendar is displayed.

NOTES
       A year starts on January 1.  The first day of the  week  is
       determined by the locale.

       The  week  numbering depends on the choice of the first day
       of the week.  If Sunday (the default) is used for the first
       day  of the week, then the customary North American number‐
       ing will be used, i.e. the first Sunday of the year  starts
       the  first  week.  If Monday is selected, then the ISO-8601
       standard week numbering is used, where the  first  Thursday
       of the year is in week number 1.

COLORS
       Implicit coloring can be disabled as follows:

              touch /etc/terminal-colors.d/cal.disable

       See  terminal-colors.d(5)  for more details about coloriza‐
       tion configuration.

BUGS
       The cal program uses the 3rd of September 1752 as the  date
       of  the  Gregorian  calendar reformation -- that is when it
       happened in Great Britain and its colonies (including  what
       is  now  the USA).  Starting at that date, eleven days were
       eliminated by this reformation, so the  calendar  for  that
       month  is  rather  unusual.  The actual historical dates at
       which the calendar reform happened  in  all  the  different
       countries (locales) are ignored.

       Alternative  calendars,  such as the Umm al-Qura, the Solar
       Hijri, the Ge'ez, or the  lunisolar  Hindu,  are  not  sup‐
       ported.

TOUCH(1)                   User Commands                  TOUCH(1)

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update  the  access  and modification times of each FILE to
       the current time.

       A FILE argument that  does  not  exist  is  created  empty,
       unless -c or -h is supplied.

       A FILE argument string of - is handled specially and causes
       touch to change the times of the file associated with stan‐
       dard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any  referenced
              file  (useful  only  on  systems that can change the
              timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or
              use:  equivalent  to  -a  WORD  is  modify or mtime:
              equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different  time-date
       formats.

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a mostly free format human readable
       date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004  16:21:42  -0800"  or
       "2004-02-29  16:21:42"  or  even  "next  Thursday".  A date
       string may contain items indicating calendar date, time  of
       day,  time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,
       and numbers.  An empty string indicates  the  beginning  of
       the  day.   The  date string format is more complex than is
       easily documented here but is fully described in  the  info
       documentation.

       By default, date pads numeric fields with zeroes.  The fol‐
       lowing optional flags may follow '%':

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After any flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal
       number; then an optional modifier, which is either E to use
       the  locale's  alternate representations if available, or O
       to use the locale's alternate numeric symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use  tzselect(1)
       to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show  the  local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast
       of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles"  09:00  next
              Fri'

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a mostly free format human readable
       date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004  16:21:42  -0800"  or
       "2004-02-29  16:21:42"  or  even  "next  Thursday".  A date
       string may contain items indicating calendar date, time  of
       day,  time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,
       and numbers.  An empty string indicates  the  beginning  of
       the  day.   The  date string format is more complex than is
       easily documented here but is fully described in  the  info
       documentation.

CAL(1)                     User Commands                    CAL(1)

NAME
       cal - display a calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
       cal [options] <timestamp|monthname>

DESCRIPTION
       cal displays a simple calendar.  If no arguments are speci‐
       fied, the current month is displayed.

       The month may be specified as a number (1-12), as  a  month
       name  or as an abbreviated month name according to the cur‐
       rent locales.

OPTIONS
       -1, --one
              Display single month output.  (This is the default.)

       -3, --three
              Display three months spanning the date.

       -n , --months number
              Display number of months, starting  from  the  month
              containing the date.

       -S, --span
              Display months spanning the date.

       -s, --sunday
              Display Sunday as the first day of the week.

       -m, --monday
              Display Monday as the first day of the week.

       -j, --julian
              Display  Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from
              January 1).

       -y, --year
              Display a calendar for the whole year.

       -Y, --twelve
              Display a calendar for the next twelve months.

       -w, --week[=number]
              Display  week  numbers  in  the  calendar   (US   or
              ISO-8601).

       --color[=when]
              Colorize the output.  The optional argument when can
              be auto, never or always.  If the when  argument  is
              omitted,  it  defaults  to  auto.  The colors can be
              disabled; for the current built-in default  see  the
              --help output.  See also the COLORS section.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

PARAMETERS
       Single digits-only parameter (e.g. 'cal 2020')
              Specifies  the  year  to be displayed; note the year
              must be fully specified: cal 89 will not  display  a
              calendar for 1989.

       Single  string  parameter  (e.g.  'cal  tomorrow'  or  'cal
       August')
              Specifies timestamp or a month name (or  abbreviated
              name) according to the current locales.

              The  special  placeholders are accepted when parsing
              timestamp, "now" may be used to refer to the current
              time,  "today",  "yesterday", "tomorrow" refer to of
              the current day, the day before  or  the  next  day,
              respectively.

              The  relative date specifications are also accepted,
              in this case "+" is evaluated to  the  current  time
              plus  the  specified  time  span. Correspondingly, a
              time span that is prefixed with "-" is evaluated  to
              the  current time minus the specified time span, for
              example '+2days'. Instead of prefixing the time span
              with  "+"  or  "-",  it  may also be suffixed with a
              space and the word "left" or "ago" (for  example  '1
              week ago').

       Two parameters (e.g. 'cal 11 2020')
              Denote the month (1 - 12) and year.

       Three parameters (e.g. 'cal 25 11 2020')
              Denote  the  day (1-31), month and year, and the day
              will be highlighted if the calendar is displayed  on
              a  terminal.   If  no  parameters are specified, the
              current month's calendar is displayed.

NOTES
       A year starts on January 1.  The first day of the  week  is
       determined by the locale.

       The  week  numbering depends on the choice of the first day
       of the week.  If Sunday (the default) is used for the first
       day  of the week, then the customary North American number‐
       ing will be used, i.e. the first Sunday of the year  starts
       the  first  week.  If Monday is selected, then the ISO-8601
       standard week numbering is used, where the  first  Thursday
       of the year is in week number 1.

COLORS
       Implicit coloring can be disabled as follows:

              touch /etc/terminal-colors.d/cal.disable

       See  terminal-colors.d(5)  for more details about coloriza‐
       tion configuration.

BUGS
       The cal program uses the 3rd of September 1752 as the  date
       of  the  Gregorian  calendar reformation -- that is when it
       happened in Great Britain and its colonies (including  what
       is  now  the USA).  Starting at that date, eleven days were
       eliminated by this reformation, so the  calendar  for  that
       month  is  rather  unusual.  The actual historical dates at
       which the calendar reform happened  in  all  the  different
       countries (locales) are ignored.

       Alternative  calendars,  such as the Umm al-Qura, the Solar
       Hijri, the Ge'ez, or the  lunisolar  Hindu,  are  not  sup‐
       ported.

TOUCH(1)                   User Commands                  TOUCH(1)

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update  the  access  and modification times of each FILE to
       the current time.

       A FILE argument that  does  not  exist  is  created  empty,
       unless -c or -h is supplied.

       A FILE argument string of - is handled specially and causes
       touch to change the times of the file associated with stan‐
       dard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any  referenced
              file  (useful  only  on  systems that can change the
              timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or
              use:  equivalent  to  -a  WORD  is  modify or mtime:
              equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different  time-date
       formats.

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a mostly free format human readable
       date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004  16:21:42  -0800"  or
       "2004-02-29  16:21:42"  or  even  "next  Thursday".  A date
       string may contain items indicating calendar date, time  of
       day,  time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,
       and numbers.  An empty string indicates  the  beginning  of
       the  day.   The  date string format is more complex than is
       easily documented here but is fully described in  the  info
       documentation.

       -      (hyphen) do not pad the field

       _      (underscore) pad with spaces

       0      (zero) pad with zeros

       ^      use upper case if possible

       #      use opposite case if possible

       After any flags comes an optional field width, as a decimal
       number; then an optional modifier, which is either E to use
       the  locale's  alternate representations if available, or O
       to use the locale's alternate numeric symbols if available.

EXAMPLES
       Convert seconds since the epoch (1970-01-01 UTC) to a date

              $ date --date='@2147483647'

       Show the time on the west coast of the US (use  tzselect(1)
       to find TZ)

              $ TZ='America/Los_Angeles' date

       Show  the  local time for 9AM next Friday on the west coast
       of the US

              $ date --date='TZ="America/Los_Angeles"  09:00  next
              Fri'

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a mostly free format human readable
       date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004  16:21:42  -0800"  or
       "2004-02-29  16:21:42"  or  even  "next  Thursday".  A date
       string may contain items indicating calendar date, time  of
       day,  time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,
       and numbers.  An empty string indicates  the  beginning  of
       the  day.   The  date string format is more complex than is
       easily documented here but is fully described in  the  info
       documentation.

CAL(1)                     User Commands                    CAL(1)

NAME
       cal - display a calendar

SYNOPSIS
       cal [options] [[[day] month] year]
       cal [options] <timestamp|monthname>

DESCRIPTION
       cal displays a simple calendar.  If no arguments are speci‐
       fied, the current month is displayed.

       The month may be specified as a number (1-12), as  a  month
       name  or as an abbreviated month name according to the cur‐
       rent locales.

OPTIONS
       -1, --one
              Display single month output.  (This is the default.)

       -3, --three
              Display three months spanning the date.

       -n , --months number
              Display number of months, starting  from  the  month
              containing the date.

       -S, --span
              Display months spanning the date.

       -s, --sunday
              Display Sunday as the first day of the week.

       -m, --monday
              Display Monday as the first day of the week.

       -j, --julian
              Display  Julian dates (days one-based, numbered from
              January 1).

       -y, --year
              Display a calendar for the whole year.

       -Y, --twelve
              Display a calendar for the next twelve months.

       -w, --week[=number]
              Display  week  numbers  in  the  calendar   (US   or
              ISO-8601).

       --color[=when]
              Colorize the output.  The optional argument when can
              be auto, never or always.  If the when  argument  is
              omitted,  it  defaults  to  auto.  The colors can be
              disabled; for the current built-in default  see  the
              --help output.  See also the COLORS section.

       -V, --version
              Display version information and exit.

       -h, --help
              Display help text and exit.

PARAMETERS
       Single digits-only parameter (e.g. 'cal 2020')
              Specifies  the  year  to be displayed; note the year
              must be fully specified: cal 89 will not  display  a
              calendar for 1989.

       Single  string  parameter  (e.g.  'cal  tomorrow'  or  'cal
       August')
              Specifies timestamp or a month name (or  abbreviated
              name) according to the current locales.

              The  special  placeholders are accepted when parsing
              timestamp, "now" may be used to refer to the current
              time,  "today",  "yesterday", "tomorrow" refer to of
              the current day, the day before  or  the  next  day,
              respectively.

              The  relative date specifications are also accepted,
              in this case "+" is evaluated to  the  current  time
              plus  the  specified  time  span. Correspondingly, a
              time span that is prefixed with "-" is evaluated  to
              the  current time minus the specified time span, for
              example '+2days'. Instead of prefixing the time span
              with  "+"  or  "-",  it  may also be suffixed with a
              space and the word "left" or "ago" (for  example  '1
              week ago').

       Two parameters (e.g. 'cal 11 2020')
              Denote the month (1 - 12) and year.

       Three parameters (e.g. 'cal 25 11 2020')
              Denote  the  day (1-31), month and year, and the day
              will be highlighted if the calendar is displayed  on
              a  terminal.   If  no  parameters are specified, the
              current month's calendar is displayed.

NOTES
       A year starts on January 1.  The first day of the  week  is
       determined by the locale.

       The  week  numbering depends on the choice of the first day
       of the week.  If Sunday (the default) is used for the first
       day  of the week, then the customary North American number‐
       ing will be used, i.e. the first Sunday of the year  starts
       the  first  week.  If Monday is selected, then the ISO-8601
       standard week numbering is used, where the  first  Thursday
       of the year is in week number 1.

COLORS
       Implicit coloring can be disabled as follows:

              touch /etc/terminal-colors.d/cal.disable

       See  terminal-colors.d(5)  for more details about coloriza‐
       tion configuration.

BUGS
       The cal program uses the 3rd of September 1752 as the  date
       of  the  Gregorian  calendar reformation -- that is when it
       happened in Great Britain and its colonies (including  what
       is  now  the USA).  Starting at that date, eleven days were
       eliminated by this reformation, so the  calendar  for  that
       month  is  rather  unusual.  The actual historical dates at
       which the calendar reform happened  in  all  the  different
       countries (locales) are ignored.

       Alternative  calendars,  such as the Umm al-Qura, the Solar
       Hijri, the Ge'ez, or the  lunisolar  Hindu,  are  not  sup‐
       ported.

TOUCH(1)                   User Commands                  TOUCH(1)

NAME
       touch - change file timestamps

SYNOPSIS
       touch [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       Update  the  access  and modification times of each FILE to
       the current time.

       A FILE argument that  does  not  exist  is  created  empty,
       unless -c or -h is supplied.

       A FILE argument string of - is handled specially and causes
       touch to change the times of the file associated with stan‐
       dard output.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       -a     change only the access time

       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files

       -d, --date=STRING
              parse STRING and use it instead of current time

       -f     (ignored)

       -h, --no-dereference
              affect each symbolic link instead of any  referenced
              file  (useful  only  on  systems that can change the
              timestamps of a symlink)

       -m     change only the modification time

       -r, --reference=FILE
              use this file's times instead of current time

       -t STAMP
              use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time

       --time=WORD
              change the specified time: WORD is access, atime, or
              use:  equivalent  to  -a  WORD  is  modify or mtime:
              equivalent to -m

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Note that the -d and -t options accept different  time-date
       formats.

DATE STRING
       The  --date=STRING  is  a mostly free format human readable
       date string such as "Sun, 29 Feb 2004  16:21:42  -0800"  or
       "2004-02-29  16:21:42"  or  even  "next  Thursday".  A date
       string may contain items indicating calendar date, time  of
       day,  time zone, day of week, relative time, relative date,
       and numbers.  An empty string indicates  the  beginning  of
       the  day.   The  date string format is more complex than is
       easily documented here but is fully described in  the  info
       documentation.
