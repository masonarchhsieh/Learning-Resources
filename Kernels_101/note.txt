Kernel

Most registers of the x86 CPU have well defined values after power-on. The Instruction Pointer (EIP) register holds the memory address for the instruction being executed by the processor. EIP is hardcoded to the value 0xFFFFFFF0. Thus, the x86 CPU is hardwired to begin execution at the physical address 0xFFFFFFF0. It is in fact, the last 16 bytes of the 32-bit address space. This memory address is called reset vector.

Now, the chipset’s memory map makes sure that 0xFFFFFFF0 is mapped to a certain part of the BIOS, not to the RAM. Meanwhile, the BIOS copies itself to the RAM for faster access. This is called shadowing. The address 0xFFFFFFF0 will contain just a jump instruction to the address in memory where BIOS has copied itself.

Thus, the BIOS code starts its execution.  BIOS first searches for a bootable device in the configured boot device order. It checks for a certain magic number to determine if the device is bootable or not. (whether bytes 511 and 512 of first sector are 0xAA55)

Once the BIOS has found a bootable device, it copies the contents of the device’s first sector into RAM starting from physical address 0x7c00; and then jumps into the address and executes the code just loaded. This code is called the bootloader.

The bootloader then loads the kernel at the physical address 0x100000. The address 0x100000 is used as the start-address for all big kernels on x86 machines.

All x86 processors begin in a simplistic 16-bit mode called real mode. The GRUB bootloader makes the switch to 32-bit protected mode by setting the lowest bit of CR0 register to 1. Thus the kernel loads in 32-bit protected mode.

Do note that in case of linux kernel, GRUB detects linux boot protocol and loads linux kernel in real mode. Linux kernel itself makes the switch to protected mode.


What all do we need?

* An x86 computer (of course)
    * Linux 
    * NASM assembler
    * gcc
    * ld (GNU Linker)
    * grub


We will use a linker script that links the object files to produce the final kernel executable. (more explained later)  In this linker script, we will explicitly specify that we want our binary to be loaded at the address 0x100000. This address, as I have said earlier, is where the kernel is expected to be. Thus, the bootloader will take care of firing the kernel’s entry point.


;;kernel.asm
    The first instruction bits 32 is not an x86 assembly instruction. It’s a directive to the NASM assembler that specifies it should generate code to run on a processor operating in 32 bit mode. It is not mandatorily required in our example, however is included here as it’s good practice to be explicit.

    The second line begins the text section (aka code section). This is where we put all our code.

    global is another NASM directive to set symbols from source code as global. By doing so, the linker knows where the symbol start is; which happens to be our entry point.

    kmain is our function that will be defined in our kernel.c file. extern declares that the function is declared elsewhere.

    Then, we have the start function, which calls the kmain function and halts the CPU using the hlt instruction. Interrupts can awake the CPU from an hlt instruction. So we disable interrupts beforehand using cli instruction. cli is short for clear-interrupts.

    We should ideally set aside some memory for the stack and point the stack pointer (esp) to it. However, it seems like GRUB does this for us and the stack pointer is already set at this point. But, just to be sure, we will allocate some space in the BSS section and point the stack pointer to the beginning of the allocated memory. We use the resb instruction which reserves memory given in bytes. After it, a label is left which will point to the edge of the reserved piece of memory. Just before the kmain is called, the stack pointer (esp) is made to point to this space using the mov instruction.


;;kernel.c
    pointer vidptr that points to the address 0xb8000. This address is the start of video memory in protected mode. The screen’s text memory is simply a chunk of memory in our address space. The memory mapped input/output for the screen starts at 0xb8000 and supports 25 lines, each line contain 80 ascii characters.

     Each character element in this text memory is represented by 16 bits (2 bytes), rather than 8 bits (1 byte) which we are used to.  The first byte should have the representation of the character as in ASCII. The second byte is the attribute-byte. This describes the formatting of the character including attributes such as color.

     To print the character s in green color on black background, we will store the character s in the first byte of the video memory address and the value 0x02 in the second byte. 
     0 represents black background and 2 represents green foreground.


     Have a look at table below for different colors:

     0 - Black, 1 - Blue, 2 - Green, 3 - Cyan, 4 - Red, 5 - Magenta, 6 - Brown, 7 - Light Grey, 8 - Dark Grey, 9 - Light Blue, 10/a - Light Green, 11/b - Light Cyan, 12/c - Light Red, 13/d - Light Magenta, 14/e - Light Brown, 15/f – White.


;;link.ld
    First, we set the output format of our output executable to be 32 bit Executable and Linkable Format (ELF). ELF is the standard binary file format for Unix-like systems on x86 architecture.

    ENTRY takes one argument. It specifies the symbol name that should be the entry point of our executable.

    SECTIONS is the most important part for us. Here, we define the layout of our executable. We could specify how the different sections are to be merged and at what location each of these is to be placed.

    Within the braces that follow the SECTIONS statement, the period character (.) represents the location counter.
    The location counter is always initialized to 0x0 at beginning of the SECTIONS block. It can be modified by assigning a new value to it.

    Remember, earlier I told you that kernel’s code should start at the address 0x100000. So, we set the location counter to 0x100000.

    Have look at the next line .text : { *(.text) }

    The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that matches any file name. The expression *(.text) thus means all .text input sections from all input files.

    So, the linker merges all text sections of the object files to the executable’s text section, at the address stored in the location counter. Thus, the code section of our executable begins at 0x100000.

    After the linker places the text output section, the value of the location counter will become 
    0x1000000 + the size of the text output section.

    Similarly, the data and bss sections are merged and placed at the then values of location-counter.


Grub and Multiboot

    Now, we have all our files ready to build the kernel. But, since we like to boot our kernel with the GRUB bootloader, there is one step left.

    There is a standard for loading various x86 kernels using a boot loader; called as Multiboot specification.

    GRUB will only load our kernel if it complies with the Multiboot spec.

    According to the spec, the kernel must contain a header (known as Multiboot header) within its first 8 KiloBytes.

    Further, This Multiboot header must contain 3 fields that are 4 byte aligned namely:

    a magic field: containing the magic number 0x1BADB002, to identify the header.
    a flags field: We will not care about this field. We will simply set it to zero.
    a checksum field: the checksum field when added to the fields ‘magic’ and ‘flags’ must give zero.
building the kernel

    We will now create object files from kernel.asm and kernel.c and then link it using our linker script.
    $ nasm -f elf32 kernel.asm -o kasm.o
    will run the assembler to create the object file kasm.o in ELF-32 bit format.
    $ gcc -m32 -c kernel.c -o kc.o
    The ’-c ’ option makes sure that after compiling, linking doesn’t implicitly happen.
    $ ld -m elf_i386 -T link.ld -o kernel kasm.o kc.o
    will run the linker with our linker script and generate the executable named kernel.


Configure your grub and run your kernel

GRUB requires your kernel to be of the name pattern kernel-<version>. So, rename the kernel. I renamed my kernel executable to kernel-701.

Now place it in the /boot directory. You will require superuser privileges to do so.

In your GRUB configuration file grub.cfg you should add an entry, something like:

title myKernel
    root (hd0,0)
        kernel /boot/kernel-701 ro

        Don’t forget to remove the directive hiddenmenu if it exists.

        Reboot your computer, and you’ll get a list selection with the name of your kernel listed.


PS:

* It’s always advisable to get yourself a virtual machine for all kinds of kernel hacking. * To run this on grub2 which is the default bootloader for newer distros, your config should look like this:
menuentry 'kernel 701' {
        set root='hd0,msdos1'
                multiboot /boot/kernel-701 ro
}



* Also, if you want to run the kernel on the qemu emulator instead of booting with GRUB, you can do so by:
qemu-system-i386 -kernel kernel

Kernel with keyboard and screen support

We communicate with I/O devices using I/O ports. These ports are just specific address on the x86’s I/O bus, nothing more. The read/write operations from these ports are accomplished using specific instructions built into the processor.

Reading from and Writing to ports
    I/O ports are accessed using the in and out instructions that are part of the x86 instruction set.

    In read_port, the port number is taken as argument. When compiler calls your function, it pushes all its arguments onto the stack. The argument is copied to the register edx using the stack pointer. The register dx is the lower 16 bits of edx. The in instruction here reads the port whose number is given by dx and puts the result in al. Register al is the lower 8 bits of eax. If you remember your college lessons, function return values are received through the eax register. Thus read_port lets us read I/O ports.

    write_port is very similar. Here we take 2 arguments: port number and the data to be written. The out instruction writes the data to the port.

Interrupts:
    how device has performed an event?
    polling - to keep checking the status of the device forever. This, for obvious reasons is not efficient and practical. This is where interrupts come into the picture. An interrupt is a signal sent to the processor by the hardware or software indicating an event. With interrupts, we can avoid polling and act only when the specific interrupt we are interested in is triggered.

    A device or a chip called Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) is responsible for x86 being an interrupt driven architecture. It manages hardware interrupts and sends them to the appropriate system interrupt.

    When certain actions are performed on a hardware device, it sends a pulse called Interrupt Request (IRQ) along its specific interrupt line to the PIC chip. The PIC then translates the received IRQ into a system interrupt, and sends a message to interrupt the CPU from whatever it is doing. It is then the kernel’s job to handle these interrupts.

    Without a PIC, we would have to poll all the devices in the system to see if an event has occurred in any of them.

    Let’s take the case of a keyboard. The keyboard works through the I/O ports 0x60 and 0x64. Port 0x60 gives the data (pressed key) and port 0x64 gives the status. However, you have to know exactly when to read these ports.

    Interrupts come quite handy here. When a key is pressed, the keyboard gives a signal to the PIC along its interrupt line IRQ1. The PIC has an offset value stored during initialization of the PIC. It adds the input line number to this offset to form the Interrupt number. Then the processor looks up a certain data structure called the Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) to give the interrupt handler address corresponding to the interrupt number.



Modern x86 systems have 2 PIC chips each having 8 input lines. Let’s call them PIC1 and PIC2. PIC1 receives IRQ0 to IRQ7 and PIC2 receives IRQ8 to IRQ15. PIC1 uses port 0x20 for Command and 0x21 for Data. PIC2 uses port 0xA0 for Command and 0xA1 for Data.

The PICs are initialized using 8-bit command words known as Initialization command words (ICW). See this link for the exact bit-by-bit syntax of these commands.

In protected mode, the first command you will need to give the two PICs is the initialize command ICW1 (0x11). This command makes the PIC wait for 3 more initialization words on the data port.

These commands tell the PICs about:
    * Its vector offset. (ICW2)
    * How the PICs wired as master/slaves. (ICW3)
    * Gives additional information about the environment. (ICW4)

    The second initialization command is the ICW2, written to the data ports of each PIC. It sets the PIC’s offset value. This is the value to which we add the input line number to form the Interrupt number.

    PICs allow cascading of their outputs to inputs between each other. This is setup using ICW3 and each bit represents cascading status for the corresponding IRQ. For now, we won’t use cascading and set all to zeroes.

    ICW4 sets the additional enviromental parameters. We will just set the lower most bit to tell the PICs we are running in the 80x86 mode.

Each PIC has an internal 8 bit register named Interrupt Mask Register (IMR). This register stores a bitmap of the IRQ lines going into the PIC. When a bit is set, the PIC ignores the request. This means we can enable and disable the nth IRQ line by making the value of the nth bit in the IMR as 0 and 1 respectively. Reading from the data port returns value in the IMR register, and writing to it sets the register. 


Now if IRQ lines are enabled, our PICs can receive signals via IRQ lines and convert them to interrupt number by adding with the offset. Now, we need to populate the IDT such that the interrupt number for the keyboard is mapped to the address of the keyboard handler function we will write.

The keyboard uses IRQ1. This is the input line 1 of PIC1. We have initialized PIC1 to an offset 0x20 (see ICW2). To find interrupt number, add 1 + 0x20 ie. 0x21. So, keyboard handler address has to be mapped against interrupt 0x21 in the IDT.

So, the next task is to populate the IDT for the interrupt 0x21.
We will map this interrupt to a function keyboard_handler which we will write in our assembly file.

Each IDT entry consist of 64 bits. In the IDT entry for the interrupt, we do not store the entire address of the handler function together. We split it into 2 parts of 16 bits. The lower bits are stored in the first 16 bits of the IDT entry and the higher 16 bits are stored in the last 16 bits of the IDT entry. This is done to maintain compatibility with the 286. You can see Intel pulls shrewd kludges like these in so many places !!

In the IDT entry, we also have to set the type - that this is done to trap an interrupt. We also need to give the kernel code segment offset. GRUB bootloader sets up a GDT for us. Each GDT entry is 8 bytes long, and the kernel code descriptor is the second segment; so its offset is 0x08 (More on this would be too much for this article). Interrupt gate is represented by 0x8e. The remaining 8 bits in the middle has to be filled with all zeroes. In this way, we have filled the IDT entry corresponding to the keyboard’s interrupt.

Once the required mappings are done in the IDT, we got to tell the CPU where the IDT is located.
This is done via the lidt assembly instruction. lidt take one operand. The operand must be a pointer to a descriptor structure that describes the IDT.

The descriptor is quite straight forward. It contains the size of IDT in bytes and its address. I have used an array to pack the values. You may also populate it using a struct.

We have the pointer in the variable idt_ptr and then pass it on to lidt using the function load_idt().
